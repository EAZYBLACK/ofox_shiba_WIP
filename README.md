# Orangefox recovery for google Pixel 7a (lynx)

This is still "work in progress". I have removed the Orangefox release again now as it was not booting up after flashing it. 

Based on September 2023 Kernel

## Installation methods:

## from recovery:
adb sideload the OrangeFox-R11.1-Unofficial-lynx.zip

## from bootloader/fastboot:
fastboot flash vendor_boot OrangeFox-R11.1-Unofficial-lynx.img
